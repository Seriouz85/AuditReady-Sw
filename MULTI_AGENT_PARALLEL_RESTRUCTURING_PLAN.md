# Multi-Agent Parallel Restructuring Strategy

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Mission**: Deploy 9 specialized agents working in parallel to refactor 296 files violating the 500-line rule while maintaining design consistency, performance, and demo functionality.

**Success Metrics**:
- All files under 500 lines
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Demo account functionality preserved
- Performance maintained or improved
- Design system consistency enforced

---

## D3 USAGE ANALYSIS & REPLACEMENT PLAN

### Current D3 Usage
**Files Found**:
- `/src/lib/org-chart/d3-org-chart.js` (1,916 lines) - Third-party library
- `/src/pages/organizations/OrgChart.tsx` - Uses d3-org-chart
- `/src/pages/organizations/OrganizationalChart.tsx` - Uses d3-org-chart

**D3 Dependencies**:
```javascript
// Core D3 modules used:
import { selection, select } from "d3-selection";
import { max, min, sum, cumsum } from "d3-array";
import { tree, stratify } from "d3-hierarchy";
import { zoom, zoomIdentity } from "d3-zoom";
import { flextree } from 'd3-flextree';
import { linkHorizontal } from 'd3-shape';
```

### Replacement Strategy
**Phase 1**: Isolate D3 Library
- Move `d3-org-chart.js` to `/src/lib/external/d3-org-chart/`
- Create TypeScript wrapper interface
- Maintain existing organizational chart functionality

**Phase 2**: Migration Planning (Future)
- Replace with ReactFlow or Mermaid.js for organizational charts
- Use unified editor components where possible
- Maintain feature parity during migration

**Immediate Action**: D3 library isolation (not replacement) to focus on 500-line rule compliance
