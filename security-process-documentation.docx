EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the "iam" process, which stands for Identity and Access Management. The "iam" process is critical for ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to organizational resources and data. This document details the procedures for user provisioning, deprovisioning, access reviews, and role-based access control within the organization. A robust "iam" process minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES

The scope of the "iam" process encompasses all users, systems, applications, and data within the organization's IT environment. This includes employees, contractors, and third-party vendors.

The objectives of the "iam" process are to:

- Ensure that user identities are accurately created, maintained, and terminated.
- Grant access based on the principle of least privilege.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to simplify access management.
- Regularly review user access rights to identify and remediate any discrepancies.
- Comply with relevant regulatory requirements and industry best practices.
- Enhance overall security posture and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

IAM PROCESS OWNER AND STAKEHOLDERS

The "iam" process owner is the Head of IT Security.

Stakeholders include:

- IT Department
- Human Resources
- Legal Department
- Compliance Department
- Business Unit Leaders
- System Administrators
- Application Owners

DETAILED IAM PROCESS STEPS

6.1 User Provisioning

6.1.1 New Employee Onboarding:
- Human Resources initiates the user provisioning process by submitting a new employee request to the IT Department.
- The IT Department creates a user account in the organization's identity management system.
- The user is assigned to appropriate roles based on their job function.
- Access to systems and applications is granted based on the assigned roles.
- The new user's access is reviewed and approved by their manager.

6.2 User Deprovisioning

6.2.1 Employee Termination/Transfer:
- Human Resources notifies the IT Department of employee terminations or transfers.
- The IT Department disables the user account in the identity management system immediately upon notification of termination.
- Access to systems and applications is revoked.
- Data owned by the user is transferred or archived as appropriate.
- The user account is archived or deleted after a specified retention period, in accordance with company policy.

6.3 Access Review

6.3.1 Periodic Access Reviews:
- Access reviews are conducted at least annually, or more frequently for high-risk systems and applications.
- Application owners and data stewards review user access rights to ensure they are still appropriate.
- Any discrepancies or unauthorized access rights are identified and remediated.
- The results of the access review are documented and reported to the Head of IT Security.

6.4 Role Management

6.4.1 Role Definition and Maintenance:
- Roles are defined based on job functions and access requirements.
- Role definitions are documented and maintained in a central repository.
- New roles are created and existing roles are modified as business needs change.
- Role assignments are regularly reviewed to ensure they are still appropriate.
