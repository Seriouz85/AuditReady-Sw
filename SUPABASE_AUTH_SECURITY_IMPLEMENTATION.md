# Supabase Auth Security Features Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides implementation instructions for enabling critical Auth security features identified by Supabase Security Advisors:

1. **Leaked Password Protection** (WARN level)
2. **Insufficient MFA Options** (WARN level)

## üîí Issue 1: Leaked Password Protection

### Problem
Supabase Auth can prevent users from using compromised passwords by checking against the HaveIBeenPwned.org database, but this feature is currently disabled.

### Solution Requirements
- **Availability**: Pro Plan and above (‚úÖ Our project is on Pro Plan)
- **Integration**: Uses HaveIBeenPwned.org Pwned Passwords API
- **Security Benefit**: Prevents credential stuffing attacks and protects users from known compromised passwords

### Manual Configuration Steps
**‚ö†Ô∏è These settings require Supabase Dashboard configuration (cannot be set via SQL/API)**

1. **Access Auth Settings**
   - Go to: [Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/quoqvqgijsbwqkqotjys/auth/providers?provider=Email)
   - Click on "Email" provider

2. **Enable Leaked Password Protection**
   - Scroll to "Password security" section
   - ‚úÖ **Enable "Prevent use of leaked passwords"**
   - This integrates with HaveIBeenPwned.org Pwned Passwords API
   - Passwords found in breach databases will be rejected

3. **Strengthen Password Requirements** (Recommended)
   - Set minimum password length: **12 characters** (currently may be lower)
   - Require character types: **Digits, lowercase, uppercase, symbols**
   - Allowed symbols: `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};'\:"|<>?,./~`

### Implementation Impact
- **New Users**: Will be prevented from using compromised passwords during signup
- **Existing Users**: Will encounter `WeakPasswordError` during sign-in if password is compromised
- **Password Changes**: All password updates will be validated against breach database

### Code Integration Example
```typescript
// Handle WeakPasswordError in sign-in flow
try {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email: email,
    password: password,
  });
  
  if (error?.message === 'Password is too weak') {
    // Show user that their password has been compromised
    setError('Your password has been found in data breaches. Please reset your password for security.');
    // Redirect to password reset flow
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Auth error:', error);
}
```

## üîê Issue 2: Insufficient MFA Options

### Problem
Project has limited MFA factor types enabled, weakening account security for users who want additional protection.

### Current MFA Status
- **TOTP (App Authenticator)**: ‚úÖ Enabled by default
- **Phone/SMS**: ‚ùå Not configured
- **Additional factors**: ‚ùå Limited options

### Solution: Enable Multiple MFA Factor Types

#### A. TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) - Already Available
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Enabled by default on all projects
- **Apps**: Google Authenticator, 1Password, Authy, Apple Keychain
- **Implementation**: Already functional via our existing MFA components

#### B. Phone/SMS MFA Configuration
**‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Supabase Dashboard configuration**

1. **Access MFA Settings**
   - Go to: [Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/quoqvqgijsbwqkqotjys/auth/providers)

2. **Configure Phone Provider**
   - Click "Phone" provider
   - ‚úÖ Enable Phone authentication
   - Configure SMS provider (Twilio recommended)
   - Set rate limits and message templates

3. **Enable Phone MFA**
   - Go to: [Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/quoqvqgijsbwqkqotjys/auth/settings)
   - Under "Multi-Factor Authentication"
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Phone (SMS)" as MFA factor type

### Enhanced MFA Implementation

#### Frontend Integration
Our existing MFA components need enhancement to support multiple factor types:

```typescript
// Enhance existing enrollment flow to support phone MFA
export function EnhancedMFAEnrollment() {
  const [selectedFactorType, setSelectedFactorType] = useState<'totp' | 'phone'>('totp');
  
  const handleEnrollment = async () => {
    if (selectedFactorType === 'totp') {
      // Existing TOTP enrollment flow
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.mfa.enroll({
        factorType: 'totp',
      });
    } else if (selectedFactorType === 'phone') {
      // New phone enrollment flow
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.mfa.enroll({
        factorType: 'phone',
        phone: phoneNumber,
      });
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Choose MFA Method</h3>
      <button onClick={() => setSelectedFactorType('totp')}>
        üì± Authenticator App (Recommended)
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setSelectedFactorType('phone')}>
        üìû SMS to Phone
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Database Policies Enhancement
Update RLS policies to support multiple factor types:

```sql
-- Enhanced MFA policy supporting multiple factor types
CREATE POLICY "Enhanced MFA enforcement"
  ON table_name
  AS RESTRICTIVE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- User has verified MFA factors (any type)
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.mfa_factors 
     WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
     AND status = 'verified') > 0
    AND
    -- Current session has aal2 (went through MFA)
    (SELECT auth.jwt()->>'aal') = 'aal2'
  );
```
