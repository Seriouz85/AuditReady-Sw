   - Interpret vague compliance language
   - Map requirements to business processes
   - Create implementation procedures
   - Coordinate across multiple teams

3. **Audit Preparation** (40-80 hours)
   - Gather evidence for each framework separately
   - Create framework-specific documentation
   - Prepare for multiple audit cycles

     step3: "Generate unified requirements",
     step4: "Export professional documentation",
     totalTime: "< 30 minutes for complete analysis"
   };
   ```

2. **Implementation Guidance** (2-4 hours)
   - Clear, actionable sub-requirements
   - Industry-specific enhancements
   - Framework cross-references maintained
   - Single implementation covers multiple standards

3. **Audit Readiness** (1-2 hours)
