# Editor Audit Report

## 1. Components & Files

- **index.ts**: Exports main editor components (`TextNode`, `ShapeNode`, `templates`).
- **templates.ts**: TypeScript interface for diagram templates (id, name, description, category, icon, nodes, edges).
- **templates.tsx**: Contains a large set of diagram templates (e.g., timelines, org charts, flowcharts) as data structures for use in the editor.
- **ShapeNode.tsx**: React component for rendering and editing shape nodes (rectangle, circle, diamond, hexagon, etc.) with context menus, drag-and-drop, and style logic.
- **TextNode.tsx**: React component for rendering and editing text nodes, supporting inline editing, selection, and style logic.

## 2. Current Feature Set

- **Diagram Types Supported**: Flowcharts, timelines, org charts, process diagrams, infographics, brainstorming layouts (via templates).
- **Node Types**: Shape nodes (various shapes), text nodes.
- **Edge/Connection Logic**: Edges are defined in templates and rendered via React Flow.
- **Node Editing**: Inline editing for text and shape nodes, context menus for shape selection.
- **Templates**: Rich set of pre-defined templates for quick diagram creation.
- **Styling**: Customizable node colors, gradients, border radii, and text styles.
- **UX**: Drag-and-drop, context menus, tooltips, and selection highlighting.

## 3. AI/Assisted Features

- **AI Integration**: Current logic supports AI-assisted diagram/image generation (Stability AI API for images).
- **Prompt-based Generation**: Users can generate diagrams or images from prompts (to be expanded).

## 4. UX/UI Patterns

- **Current Look & Feel**: Modern, with both light and dark themes. Uses Material UI for components and styling. Layout is clean but can be further modernized for a more professional, sleek appearance (see inspiration images).
- **Strengths**: Modular components, good use of context menus and inline editing, flexible template system.
- **Pain Points**: UI can be further polished for a lighter, more professional look. Some logic may be tightly coupled (to be reviewed in refactor steps).

## 5. Reusable Logic & Areas for Improvement

- **Reusable**: Node and template logic is modular and can be extended. Shape and text node components are well-structured.
- **Needs Improvement**:
  - Expand support for all mermaid.js diagram types.
  - Add import/export for mermaid.js syntax.
  - Integrate auto-layout engines (dagre, D3).
  - Further modularize and decouple logic for extensibility.
  - Modernize UI for a lighter, more professional look (see inspiration images).
