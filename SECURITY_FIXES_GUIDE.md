# Database Security Fixes Guide

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues Fixed

This guide addresses the remaining security issues from the Supabase security advisors:

### Issues Addressed:
1. **ERROR - Security Definer Views** (2 instances)
   - `public.requirement_embeddings_stats`
   - `public.extension_security_audit`

2. **WARN - Function Search Path** (2 instances)
   - Duplicate `public.find_similar_requirements` functions with mutable search_path

3. **Cleanup** - Orphaned database objects

## 🔧 How to Apply the Fixes

### Method 1: Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Open the file: `database-security-fixes.sql`
4. Copy and paste the entire content
5. Click "Run" to execute all fixes

### Method 2: Migration File
1. The migration file is ready at: `supabase/migrations/20250925_fix_remaining_security_issues.sql`
2. Apply via Supabase CLI when available:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After applying the fixes, verify they worked:

### 1. Check Security Advisors
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Security
- Run security advisors again
- Confirm ERROR level issues are resolved

### 2. Verify Views Are Fixed
```sql
-- This query should show views WITHOUT SECURITY DEFINER
SELECT schemaname, viewname, definition 
FROM pg_views 
WHERE viewname IN ('requirement_embeddings_stats', 'extension_security_audit')
AND schemaname = 'public';
```

### 3. Verify Function Is Fixed
```sql
-- This should show only ONE function without duplicates
SELECT proname, pronargs, prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'find_similar_requirements' 
AND pronamespace = (SELECT oid FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname = 'public');
```

### 4. Test Function Still Works
```sql
-- Test the function still operates correctly
SELECT * FROM find_similar_requirements('[0.1,0.2,0.3]'::text, 5, 0.5) LIMIT 1;
```

## 🛡️ Security Improvements Applied

### Before (Problematic):
- Views used `SECURITY DEFINER` (privilege escalation risk)
- Duplicate functions with mutable `search_path` (SQL injection risk)
- Orphaned objects cluttering the schema

### After (Secure):
- Views use `SECURITY INVOKER` (runs with caller's privileges)
- Single function with immutable `search_path = 'public'`
- Clean schema with proper permissions
- All objects have proper RLS policies

## 📊 Expected Security Advisor Results

After applying fixes, you should see:
- ✅ **ERROR level issues**: 0 (down from 4)
- ⚠️ **WARN level issues**: Minimal (only configuration items)
- ℹ️ **INFO level issues**: Only platform-managed items

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

If security advisors still show ERROR level issues:

1. **Check execution**: Ensure all SQL ran without errors
2. **Verify permissions**: Check that you have sufficient database privileges
3. **Manual cleanup**: Look for any missed duplicate objects:
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, viewname FROM pg_views WHERE definition ILIKE '%security definer%';
   SELECT proname, count(*) FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE '%similar%' GROUP BY proname HAVING count(*) > 1;
   ```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **Security Advisor shows 0 ERROR level issues**  
✅ **No SECURITY DEFINER views in public schema**  
✅ **Single find_similar_requirements function with immutable search_path**  
✅ **All views and functions work correctly**  
✅ **Proper RLS policies maintained**

## 📝 Notes

- These fixes maintain all existing functionality while improving security
- No data is lost or modified - only database object definitions are updated
- All permissions and RLS policies are preserved
- The changes are fully reversible if needed (though not recommended)
