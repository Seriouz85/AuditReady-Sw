# 🚀 SaaS Setup Guide - Stripe & Supabase Integration

## ✅ Current Status
- **Supabase MCP**: ✅ Working
- **Stripe API**: ✅ Working  
- **Products/Prices**: ✅ Created
- **Admin Console**: ✅ Enhanced

## 🔧 Immediate Setup Steps

### 1. Get Supabase Service Role Key

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/quoqvqgijsbwqkqotjys)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API**
3. Copy the **Service Role Key** (secret key - starts with `eyJ...`)
4. Add it to your `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...your_service_role_key
```

### 2. Stripe Webhooks (Optional for Development)

**What are webhooks for?**
- Real-time updates when subscriptions change
- Automatic database sync when payments succeed/fail
- Handle trial endings and cancellations

**For Development (Skip for now):**
- Your current setup works without webhooks
- The admin console can sync manually via API calls

**For Production (Later):**
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Create endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Add these events:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated` 
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

### 3. Test Your Setup

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test Supabase connection
npm run test:supabase

# Test Stripe connection  
npm run test:stripe

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### ✅ Working Features:
1. **Enhanced Admin Console** (`/admin`)
   - Real customer data from Stripe + Supabase
   - Subscription management (pause, resume, cancel)
   - Revenue metrics and analytics
   - System health monitoring

2. **Onboarding Flow** (`/onboarding`)
   - Enhanced onboarding with Stripe integration
   - Automatic plan recommendations
   - Payment processing for paid plans

3. **Subscription Plans**:
   - **Free**: $0/month (no Stripe needed)
   - **Team**: $499/month 
   - **Business**: $699/month
   - **Enterprise**: $999/month

### 🔄 Missing Integrations:

1. **Pricing Assessment Page**
   - Currently no Stripe integration
   - Should redirect to onboarding with recommended plan

2. **Original Onboarding Page**
   - No Stripe integration
   - Consider replacing with EnhancedOnboarding

## 🚀 Testing Scenarios

### Test Admin Console:
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Should show real data from your Stripe account
3. Test connection status indicators
4. Try customer portal sessions

### Test Enhanced Onboarding:
1. Go to `/enhanced-onboarding` (or update route)
2. Fill out organization info
3. Select a paid plan
4. Should redirect to Stripe Checkout

### Test Free Plan Onboarding:
1. Complete onboarding with "Free" plan
2. Should skip payment and go directly to dashboard

## ⚠️ Warnings Explained

### "Multiple GoTrueClient instances"
- **Fixed**: ✅ Updated to use singleton pattern
- **Cause**: Multiple Supabase client instances
- **Impact**: None (just a warning)

### "Stripe.js integration over HTTP"
- **Normal**: ✅ Expected in development
- **Cause**: Running on localhost (HTTP)
- **Production**: Must use HTTPS

## 🛠️ Next Steps

1. **Add service role key** to `.env`
2. **Test enhanced onboarding** flow
3. **Update routing** to use EnhancedOnboarding
4. **Add Stripe integration** to PricingAssessment page
5. **Set up webhooks** when ready for production

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Never commit** service role key to git
- **Use environment variables** for all secrets
- **Service role key** bypasses RLS (admin use only)
- **Webhooks** require signature verification in production

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify environment variables are loaded
3. Test API connections individually
4. Review this guide for missing steps
