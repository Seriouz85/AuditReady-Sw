## 📋 **HOW TO USE THE NEW SYSTEM**

### **Option 1: Direct Replacement (Recommended)**
```typescript
// Replace this import:
import { AssessmentReport } from '@/components/assessments/AssessmentReport';

// With this:
import { NewAssessmentReport } from '@/components/assessments/NewAssessmentReport';

// Usage remains the same:
<NewAssessmentReport
  assessment={assessment}
  requirements={requirements}
  standards={standards}
  onClose={onClose}
/>
```

### **Option 2: Direct Service Usage**
```typescript
import { UnifiedExportService } from '@/services/assessments/UnifiedExportService';

const exportService = UnifiedExportService.getInstance();

// Export PDF (fast, small files)
await exportService.exportPDF(assessment, requirements, standards);

// Export Word (consistent formatting)
await exportService.exportWord(assessment, requirements, standards);

// Export CSV (clean data)
exportService.exportCSV(assessment, requirements, standards);
```

## ✅ **VALIDATION COMPLETED**

### **Build Testing:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Vite build completed without errors
- ✅ No lint errors in new code
- ✅ All new components properly typed

### **Code Quality:**
- ✅ Follows project conventions
