### Step 2: Create New Repository on GitHub
**Manual Steps**:
1. Go to GitHub.com and log in
2. Click "New" repository button
3. Repository name: `AuditReady-Sw`
4. Description: `🏆 Enterprise Compliance Platform - Complete Software Engineering Transformation. From "80% junk" to 95% production-ready with AI-friendly architecture, 90% security compliance, and 64% performance improvement.`
5. Set to **Public** (to showcase the transformation)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we have our own)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Connect and Push to New Repository
```bash
# Remove current remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new repository remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AuditReady-Sw.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Push to new repository
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Repository Setup
```bash
# Check that everything was pushed
git log --oneline -5

# Verify remote repository
git remote show origin
```
