  - Accessibility and UI integrity checking

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure application is running
npm run dev

# Install Playwright if not already installed
npm install @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run complete quality analysis
./tests/run-quality-check.sh

# Or run individual test suites
npm run test:e2e -- quality-checker.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- console-monitor.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- admin-flows.spec.ts
```

### Focused Testing
```bash
# Test specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium-quality

# Test specific route
npx playwright test quality-checker.spec.ts --grep "Dashboard"

# Run with UI for debugging
npx playwright test --ui
```

## üìä Report Generation

### Automated Reports
The quality checker generates several types of reports:

1. **JSON Report**: `tests/reports/quality-report-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
   - Detailed error breakdown by page and severity
   - Performance metrics
   - Accessibility issues
   - Fix recommendations

2. **Markdown Summary**: `tests/reports/quality-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Executive summary
   - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
   - Prioritized recommendations

3. **Playwright HTML Report**: `tests/reports/playwright-report/`
   - Visual test results
   - Screenshots and traces
   - Detailed test execution logs

### Screenshots
Visual evidence captured in `tests/screenshots/`:
- Page screenshots for each route tested
- Error state captures
- Email preview modal screenshots
- Admin interface screenshots

## üö® Known Issues Detection

The quality checker specifically looks for these known issues:

### Critical Issues
1. **handleInviteUser Function Missing**
   - Location: OrganizationDetail component
   - Impact: User invitation system broken
   - Fix: Implement handleInviteUser function

2. **Email Service Edge Function Missing**
   - Location: Supabase Edge Functions
   - Impact: Email sending functionality broken
   - Fix: Create and deploy `send-email` Edge Function

### High Priority Issues
3. **Audit Logger Errors**
   - Error: `table_name is not defined`
   - Impact: Audit trail functionality compromised
   - Fix: Properly define table_name parameter

4. **Organization Roles Service**
   - Error: `getOrganizationRoles is not a function`
   - Impact: Role management broken
   - Fix: Implement getOrganizationRoles method

## üîß Error Categorization

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Blocks core functionality, immediate fix required
- **High**: Affects user experience, fix within 24 hours
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, fix within week
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, fix when convenient

### Error Types
- `missing_function`: Function not implemented
- `missing_edge_function`: Supabase Edge Function not found
- `audit_logger_error`: Audit logging issues
- `authentication_error`: Auth-related problems
- `database_error`: Database connection/query issues
- `react_error`: React component errors
- `network_failure`: API/network issues

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- Page load times (warning >5s, critical >10s)
- Memory usage patterns
- Network request failures
- JavaScript execution errors

### Performance Thresholds
- **Acceptable**: <3 seconds load time
- **Warning**: 3-5 seconds load time
- **Critical**: >5 seconds load time

## ‚ôø Accessibility Checking

### WCAG Compliance
- Alt text validation for images
- Form label requirements
- Heading structure verification
- Color contrast checking (when available)

### Accessibility Levels
- **Level A**: Basic accessibility requirements
- **Level AA**: Standard compliance level
- **Level AAA**: Enhanced accessibility

## üåê Cross-Browser Testing

### Supported Browsers
- **Chromium**: Primary testing browser with enhanced logging
- **Firefox**: Cross-browser compatibility
- **WebKit**: Safari compatibility
- **Mobile Chrome**: Mobile responsiveness

### Mobile-Specific Checks
- Touch interaction functionality
- Responsive design validation
- Mobile-specific error patterns

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Run Quality Tests
  run: |
    npm run dev &
    sleep 10
    ./tests/run-quality-check.sh
    
- name: Upload Quality Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: quality-reports
    path: tests/reports/
```

### Pre-Deployment Checks
1. Run quality tests before deployment
2. Ensure no critical errors exist
3. Verify performance thresholds met
4. Check accessibility compliance

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application Not Starting
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is available
lsof -ti:3000

# Start application in background for testing
npm run dev &
```

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Run with verbose logging
npx playwright test --reporter=verbose

# Debug specific test
npx playwright test quality-checker.spec.ts --debug
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x tests/run-quality-check.sh

# Fix directory permissions
mkdir -p tests/reports tests/screenshots
```
